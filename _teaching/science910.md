I co-teach a class with a 1:7 ratio of teachers to students. The interdisciplinary core class covers a rotating selection of high school science, history, and English content organized around a theme. This year's theme was Justice, and the science content included cell biology and chemistry. Last year's theme was To Infinity and Beyond, and the science content included environmental biology and astronomy. (Fall 2023-Spring 2025)
