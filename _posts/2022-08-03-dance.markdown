I started taking dance classes again after several years of hiatus. I am very rusty, but always improving. I am also trying new styles that I hadn't tried before, such as hip-hop and K-pop styles. I don't have any performance videos to post yet, but hopefully someday I will. Until then, I'm enjoying the fun music, cardio exercise, and meeting new friends.
