I teach a semi-intensive intermediate ESL class in the evenings. I plan and teach lessons according to the school curriculum, which includes grammar, speaking, writing, reading, and listening. The class is hybrid, so I teach students in-person while simultaneously including more students to join remotely using Zoom. I am responsible for attendance, administering exams, and grading.
