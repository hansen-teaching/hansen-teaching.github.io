I refactored the Data unit of of the middle school Data, Probability and Statistics curriculum. I added an introductory lesson that reviewed elementary school level data concepts such as dot plots. I added more explicit lessons about median, mode, and range. I refactored the unit project and added an example project. Finally, I moved the more advanced lessons to a future unit.
